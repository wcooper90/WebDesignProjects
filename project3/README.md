# Project 3

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

All templates are in the templates/orders folder, except layout.html (just in templates)

Models has three models -- one for a userprofile (links user to their cart), one for a cart, and one for the menu objects.

Views has a number of functions, the most important and complicated ones being Menu and Cart. These do all the heavy work in terms of figuring out orders.
