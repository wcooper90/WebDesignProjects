The purpose of CRLS Takes is to replace the sports section of the school newspaper at
CRLS, the register forum. If enough people are interested, it could even continue as a
web development/sports interest club in following years.

When you register for the site, you can write takes or blogs. Blogs are your regular
pieces of writing. You select a genre and begin to write, and it will be posted to
that page as soon as you are done. Takes are a little different. They are shorter, usually
one to two sentences, and always start off with a rating of Lukewarm. Others can vote on Takes,
and they can have scores from 1-5, 1 being freezing cold and 5 being scalding.

Your profile page tells you when you joined the website, how many and which blogs you've posted.

The about page is pretty self explanatory.

Application.py is the file which contains almost everything. There are a lot of html pages
and a few css sheets, nothing unusual. The sql file contains the sql commands I used
for the database through adminer, as well as the credentials needed to get on the
web interface.
