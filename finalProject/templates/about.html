      CRLS-Takes is a blog based entertainment website made for CRLS students. It was created
      in 2019 by Will Cooper as a new club for CRLS students to show creativity.
      The website gives every student with a account the ability to post and edit blogs and
      comment on existing content. This is moderated by the club leaders who have to approve
      all posted content.

      <span class="purple">Why blog?</span>
    </h2>
    <p class="readableText">
      Blogging is a more inclusive form of writing that will reach more people.
      Blog writing is unlike journalistic writing as it allows for more opinion based
      writing and has a lower standard. This combination is perfect to help include the
      most amount of people who want to share their opinions but donâ€™t know how or where.

    <h2>
      <span class="purple">What type of content sets CRLS Takes apart?</span>
    </h2>
    <p class="readableText">
      The looser editing allows for much more entertaining and less regulated content than
      any other club at CRLS. The timetable for editing (or the lack thereof) allows content
      to be posted much more quickly allowing the website to stay on top of current events
      and have fresh topics.
    </p>
    <h2>
      <span class="purple">How do I post?</span>
    </h2>
    <p class="readableText">
      Posting is as simple as clicking the write tab. If you have an account you will be
      directed to a page where you can type a header and an article/spiel about any topic
      you want. After writing, you simply press publish and it will be sent to one of the
      head editors. They will loosely edit any glaring grammar and spelling mistakes and
      make sure the topic is approved for the website then post it onto the site. Once it
      is up people can rate the article and comment their opinions.
    </p>
    <h2>
      <span class="purple">Do you store user data?</span>
    </h2>
    <p class="readableText">
      The database only collects name, grade, and username from any user on the site. As
      the user interacts with the site, the data collected from comments, articles, and
      ratings will show up on their own personal page for other people on the site to see.
